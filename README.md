# Data-engineering-Azure-Based Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This project leverages Microsoft Azure to process and analyze sales data, integrating various Azure services to create a streamlined data pipeline. The goal is to transform raw sales data into actionable insights using Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Power BI.

## Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Uses Azure Data Factory to extract data from multiple sources.
- **Data Transformation**: Implements a Silver Layer in Azure Synapse for refined, structured data.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Power BI for interactive dashboards and reports.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large volumes of sales data efficiently.

## Technology Stack
- **Azure Data Factory**: For ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: For data storage and transformation.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: For raw data storage.
- **Power BI**: For visualization and reporting.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Azure Subscription**: Ensure you have an active Azure account.
2. **Resource Deployment**:
   - Set up Azure Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, and Blob Storage.
   - Configure linked services for data integration.
3. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Use Data Factory to extract and load data into Blob Storage.
4. **Data Transformation**:
   - Define transformation logic in the Silver Layer using Synapse SQL.
5. **Visualization**:
   - Connect Power BI to Synapse for creating reports.

## How It Works
1. Raw data is ingested into Azure Blob Storage.
2. Azure Data Factory processes and moves data into the Silver Layer in Synapse.
3. Transformed data is stored in Synapse for analytics and reporting.
4. Power BI connects to Synapse for real-time insights.

## File Structure
- `Silver layer.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing transformation logic for the Silver Layer.
- `Data_Ingestion_Pipeline.json`: JSON configuration for Azure Data Factory pipeline.
- `PowerBI_Report.pbix`: Power BI report file for data visualization.

## Future Enhancements
- Automate pipeline scheduling using Azure Data Factory triggers.
- Implement machine learning models for predictive analytics.
- Optimize performance using partitioning and indexing strategies.
